# Build-A-Home
![Header Image](/GitHubAssets/header.png)

This repository contains the Unity code for the remake of the Build-A-Home game hosted on the site elouai.com. The web-archived version of the game is available [here](https://web.archive.org/web/20150424050725/http://elouai.com/build-a-home/index.php) but features bugs and does not work in full functionality. 

As an avid elouai-user, I found that it was my duty and calling to restore this game, so please enjoy! If you find any bugs, feel free to comment them below! (also be on the lookout for the source code!)

**Note that all assets belong to the original creator and are not made by Linda Lor (DoodleLor) nor belong to me.**

The game can be played in-browser at my itch profile [here](https://doodlelor.itch.io/build-a-home-remake)!
